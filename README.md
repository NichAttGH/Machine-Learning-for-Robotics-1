The assignments are:
1) Naive Bayes classifier
2) Linear regression
3) kNN Classifier
4) Neural Networks

For each Assignment, there is a report into each folder that explains what it consists of (there is even a final report for the assignments all together).

Download here the [mnist](https://2023.aulaweb.unige.it/pluginfile.php/211469/mod_assign/intro/mnist.zip) dataset for the 3° and 4° assignments (too big for github).
