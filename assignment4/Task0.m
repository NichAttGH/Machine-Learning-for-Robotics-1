%% Lab 4: neural networks
%% Task 0: Neural networks in Matlab
% In this task you will use Matlab's own neural network tools, contained in 
% the Neural Networks Toolbox library:
% 
% <https://it.mathworks.com/help/nnet/gs/shallow-networks-for-pattern-recognition-clustering-and-time-series.html 
% Matlab doc page: The Neural Networks Toolbox> ("Shallow networks")
% 
% There are four ways you can use the Deep Learning Toolbox software. The first 
% way is through its tools. These tools provide a convenient way to access the 
% capabilities of the toolbox for the following tasks:
%% 
% * *Function fitting* (<https://it.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/nftool.html  
% |nftool|>)
% * Pattern recognition (<https://it.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/nprtool.html  
% |nprtool|>)
% * Data clustering (<https://it.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/nctool.html  
% |nctool|>)
% * Time-series analysis (<https://it.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/ntstool.html
